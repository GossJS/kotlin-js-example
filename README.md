# Kotlin 1.1 JS Example
This project aims to provide a minimal working Gradle template
for developers targeting the Kotlin 1.1 JS compiler. 
 
It was hard to find a working, up-to-date example, so I decided
to take [this one](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/libraries/examples/browser-example),
read [this tutorial](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/javascript/getting-started-gradle/getting-started-with-gradle.html)
and modified it.

1. ``git clone https://github.com/bascan/kotlin-js-example.git``

1. ``cd kotlin-js-example``

1. ``./gradlew clean build``

1. Point your browser to the ``./script/index.html`` file

Do you see ``Some Dynamically Created Content!!!``?
Congratulations! You're all set.

Have fun :-)
